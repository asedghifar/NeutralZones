Scripts used in "The Spatial Mixing of Genomes in Secondary Contact Zones"

simulations_under_process.R: generates simulated chromosomes in discrete populations that have undergone secondary contact.  
fit_contact_zone.R: provides a function for expected LD in a contact zone, and describes fitting to genome-wide LD decay curves.
